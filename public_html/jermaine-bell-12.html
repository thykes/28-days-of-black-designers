				<h2>Tell me about the work you've done?</h2>
				<p>I got my start as a professional designer in an Advertising Agency, there I mostly worked on social media advertisements and email marketing for companies like Michelob Ultra &amp; Liberty Mutual. Since leaving the agency I continued to have a focus on social media design and even branched out to social media management. But, lately my work has drifted more towards grassroots organizations, artists, non-profits, and start ups. However, I still dabble in corporate work. I just designed some collateral with Red Bull Amaphiko Academy for their upcoming launch here in Baltimore.</p>

				<h2>What are your proudest accomplishments of your career?</h2>
				<p>Launching my own small business jtbeezwax, a line of Stationery &amp; Prints. It started as just e-commerce, but just one year in, and I am carried at Nubian Hueman in DC and Keeper's Vintage &amp; Knits, Soy, Metal boutique in Baltimore.</p>

				<h2>What have been your biggest struggles of your career?</h2>
				<p>Completing a design degree as an adult, an "untraditional student" with 15 credits, 60 hours or more of homework, all while working two part time jobs, and maintaining a relationship was definitely my biggest challenge! But, I wanted to learn everything I could about design, and I wanted to do that at MICA, and, I did!</p>
				</section>

				<h2>What are you doing that's special that sets you apart from your careers?</h2>
				<p>I am an Open Society Institute Fellow currently, which allows me to plan and develop programming that is near to my heart. I'm helping Artist Pierre Bennu create capacity and programming at ExitTheApple his studio, which he has opened to the community as a space for gatherings like community meetings or even art openings.</p>

				<h2>What have your experience been as a person of color in the design industry?</h2>
				<p>It's been interesting! I have learned a whole lot by being the only person of color in a lot of rooms, but even in the 7 or so years that I have been doing it professionally, I am happy to be seeing changes, slowly but surely!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people?</h2>
				<p>Design can stop thinking of itself as an institution, and instead as a collective of human beings. The idea that "design" is an impenetrable monolith is what allows people to hide, and not hire underrepresented people!</p>
